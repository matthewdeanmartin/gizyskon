## Set up

"And then, if you sum the value of each remaining letter, break that sum into its digits, add 6, then convert back into letters, you get the word "Bullshit.""

So my non-smart guess it that either this

- has one solution
- infinite solutions because there are too many areas for interpretatoin
- no solutions

I think the problem is the "remaining letter"- if you get rid of the front of some string (or any part of it, even if it was every other letter removed or decimation), it isn't going to affect the answer anymore.

[I asked ChatGPT and it said, GIZYSKON](https://chatgpt.com/share/68df013c-7148-8007-8f1f-bda74ca570f4).

Because this is now just like a letter map shifted by 6.
